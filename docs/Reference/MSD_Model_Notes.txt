MSD Model Analysis Notes
========================
Date: 2025-11-24

MODEL FILES
-----------
1. msd_model.pth (672 KB)
   - Type: Trained PyTorch neural network
   - Contents:
     * Model weights (6 layers)
     * Scaler parameters (518 features)
     * 16 genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Easy Listening, Electronic, 
       Experimental, Folk, Hip-Hop, Instrumental, International, Jazz, 
       Old-Time/Historic, Pop, Rock, Soul-RnB, Spoken
     * Training: Epoch 7, Accuracy 77.09%
   - Purpose: Use for genre prediction
   - Contains: NO song data, NO track IDs

2. msd_tagtraum_cd1.cls (3.8 MB)
   - Type: Plain text label file
   - Contents: Track ID → Genre mappings
   - Format: TRACKID\tGenre1\tGenre2
   - Total labels: 133,676 songs
   - Purpose: Training/validation labels

DATA AVAILABLE
--------------
- H5 feature files: 10,000 songs (in Data/A/ and Data/B/)
- Label file: 133,676 songs
- Model trained on: ~10,000 songs (intersection)

COMBINING FILES
---------------
Decision: Keep separate H5 files
Reasons:
- Better memory efficiency (load on-demand)
- Easier parallel processing
- More fault-tolerant
- Standard MSD format

BETTER ALTERNATIVES
-------------------
For more features, use:
1. OpenJMLA (already have): 1.3 GB, 86M params
   Location: /media/mijesu_970/SSD_Data/AI_models/OpenJMLA/
2. Hugging Face models: MERT-v1-330M, AST
3. TorchAudio: wav2vec2
4. Essentia models

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Use OpenJMLA for classification - much larger and more powerful than MSD model.

Where to Get Better MSD Models
===============================
Date: 2025-11-24

CURRENT MODEL STATUS
--------------------
- Current: msd_model.pth (672 KB, 77.09% accuracy)
- Trained on: ~10,000 songs
- Features: 518 features
- Genres: 16 genres

OPTIONS TO GET BETTER MODELS
-----------------------------

1. TRAIN YOUR OWN (Best Option)
   - Use existing 10,000 H5 files
   - Script: /media/mijesu_970/SSD_Data/Python/Music_Reclass/train_msd_features.py
   - Modify: Add more layers, increase epochs, tune hyperparameters
   - Advantage: Customized for your needs

2. MILLION SONG DATASET OFFICIAL
   - Website: http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/code/
   - GitHub: https://github.com/tbertinmahieux/MSongsDB
   - Contains: Official benchmarks and pre-trained models

3. ACOUSTICBRAINZ
   - Website: https://acousticbrainz.org/
   - Features: Pre-computed audio features for MSD
   - Advantage: More features than basic MSD (hundreds of features)

4. RESEARCH PAPERS
   - "Deep content-based music recommendation" (van den Oord et al.)
   - GitHub: https://github.com/benanne/kaggle-ndsb
   - Various MSD-trained deep learning models

5. KAGGLE DATASETS
   - Search: "Million Song Dataset models"
   - URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=million+song
   - Community-shared pre-trained models

6. FULL MSD DOWNLOAD
   - Complete subset: 280GB
   - Command: wget http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/msd_summary_file.h5
   - Contains: All 1M songs features

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Priority 1: Train better model with existing 10,000 songs
Priority 2: Use OpenJMLA (already have, 1.3GB, 86M params)
Priority 3: Download from official MSD sources if needed

NEXT STEPS
----------
[ ] Review train_msd_features.py script
[ ] Increase model complexity (more layers)
[ ] Train for more epochs
[ ] Compare with OpenJMLA results
